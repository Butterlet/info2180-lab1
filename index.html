        <h2>Paris Wolfe</h2>
        <p>My Name is Paris Wolfe and I am fond of cats, video games (like Baldur's Gate 3, Valorant, and Sims 4), anime, and hanging out with friends. Originally, I wished to be a professional artist but the older I got, the more interested I got in computer science, specifically web development and this is because itâ€™s such an exciting field. It serves as a creative outlet for someone like me who is deeply interested in design and keeps my brain working with its problem-solving aspects. While I do lean more toward the front-end side of web development, I can still appreciate the importance of back-end development in creating an enjoyable user experience. Both aspects can be pretty challenging, but in the end, seeing a fully functioning final product is incredibly rewarding. Not to mention that since technology is ever-evolving, it keeps things engaging and encourages me to keep practicing. </p>
